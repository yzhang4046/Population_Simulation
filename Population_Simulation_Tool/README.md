Population & Demographics Simulation
</h1>

## Current Progress Update

We have successfully developed and deployed a Streamlit-based population simulation tool.  
Our current prototype supports interactive experimentation with demographic trends and policies.

### Core Features

- Agent-based simulation of population dynamics:
  - Fertility, mortality, and partner formation mechanisms
  - Education and income effects on reproduction behavior
- Policy scenario testing with configurable events:
  - Child support programs
  - Immigration waves
  - Baby boom periods
- Visualized outputs including:
  - Population size, dependency ratio, education levels
  - Urban vs. rural distribution
  - Age histograms and fertility age distributions

### Running the App

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
